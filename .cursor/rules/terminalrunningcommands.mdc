## Terminal Workflow Rules for Flutter Projects (Android Focused)

### Priority Execution Flow
1. **Device Verification First**:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
Checks for connected Android devices/emulators

Must show at least one Android device before proceeding

Run on Android (Priority):

bash
flutter run -d android
Only executes if Android device is connected

Automatically performs implicit flutter pub get if needed

Fallback Procedures
If No Android Device:

bash
flutter build apk --debug
Builds debug APK without requiring device

Validates basic project integrity

Dependency Recovery:

bash
flutter clean && flutter pub get
Run only when:

Build fails

Switching branches

Pubspec.yaml modified

Essential Checks Table
Condition	Command	Notes
Android device connected	flutter run -d android	Primary development command
No device available	flutter build apk --debug	Basic compilation check
Dependency issues	flutter clean && flutter pub get	Clean reset
Code validation	flutter analyze	Pre-commit check
Strict Rule:
Never run flutter run blindly

Always verify device connection first with flutter devices

If no Android devices appear:

Connect physical device (USB debugging enabled)

Launch Android emulator

Only then use fallback build commands

Recommended Workflow:
bash
# Step 1: Check devices
flutter devices

# If Android device appears:
flutter run -d android

# If no devices:
flutter build apk --debug && flutter analyze
